In this analysis, we take a look at data from a personal activity monitoring device
with measures the number of steps taken by the wearer, in five-minute intervals over
the course of two months (October and November 2012).

The dataset is available from the [Coursera website][1] and is also included in this
repository. Variables include (per README.md):

* steps: Number of steps taking in a 5-minute interval (missing values are coded as NA)
* date: The date on which the measurement was taken in YYYY-MM-DD format
* interval: Identifier for the 5-minute interval in which measurement was taken

and a total of 17568 observations.

## Loading and preprocessing the data

First we load in the data for processing, converting the `date` field into a `Date`:

```{r}
data <- read.csv(unz("activity.zip", "activity.csv"), header=T)
data$date <- as.Date(data$date)
str(data)
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

Now, we calculate the total number of steps taken on each day, ignoring any missing
values, and histogram them:

```{r}
d <- data %>% group_by(date) %>% summarize(totalSteps=sum(steps))
medianSteps <- median(d$totalSteps, na.rm=T)
meanSteps <- mean(d$totalSteps, na.rm=T)
hist(d$totalSteps, main='', xlab='Number of Steps', breaks=8)
```

The mean number of total steps per day is `r meanSteps` and the median is
`r medianSteps`.

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

```{r}
d <- data %>% group_by(interval) %>% summarize(meanSteps=mean(steps, na.rm=T))
maxSteps <- which.max(d$meanSteps)
plot(d$interval, d$meanSteps, main='', xlab='Interval', ylab='Mean Number of Steps', type='l')
```

The five-minute interval with the maximum number of steps (`r d$meanSteps[[maxSteps]]`) is
the `r maxSteps`th interval, `r d$interval[[maxSteps]]`.

## Imputing missing values

We now consider how to deal with missing values in the dataset. First, we ask how many
rows with missing values there are.

```{r}
nmissing <- nrow(data) - sum(complete.cases(data))
```

The number of rows with missing data is `r nmissing`.

Now, we employ a strategy for handling the missing data in our subsequent analysis.

Here we replace missing values with the mean number of steps for the given
time interval, averaged across all days:
```{r}
dt <- data %>% group_by(interval) %>% mutate(meanSteps=mean(steps, na.rm=T)) %>% ungroup
badValues <- is.na(dt$steps)
dt$steps[badValues] = dt$meanSteps[badValues]
```

With the missing values replaced, we remake the histogram above:

```{r}
dt2 <- dt %>% group_by(date) %>% summarize(totalSteps=sum(steps))
medianSteps <- median(dt2$totalSteps, na.rm=T)
meanSteps <- mean(dt2$totalSteps, na.rm=T)
hist(dt2$totalSteps, main='', xlab='Number of Steps', breaks=8)
```

The mean number of total steps per day is `r meanSteps` and the median is
`r medianSteps`. For this choice of imputing, the mean is unchanged and the
median now coincides with the mean, and is no longer an integer since we
filled in steps with an average.

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

Finally, we investigate whether the activity patterns are different on weekdays
and weekends. To begin, we create a new column which denotes whether a day is
a weekend or weekday:

```{r}
dtw <- dt %>% mutate(daytype=grepl('Sat|Sun', weekdays(date)))
dtw$daytype[dtw$daytype==F] = 'weekday'
dtw$daytype[dtw$daytype==T] = 'weekend'
dtw$datype <- as.factor(dtw$daytype)
```

Then, we summarize by the day type (weekend/weekday) and the time interval (like
the time series above) to create a panel plot:

```{r}
dtw2 <- dtw %>% group_by(daytype, interval) %>% summarize(meanSteps=mean(steps))
p <- ggplot(dtw2, aes(interval, meanSteps)) +
       geom_line() +
       facet_grid(facets=daytype~., scale='free_y') +
       theme_bw() +
       xlab('Interval') +
       ylab('Mean Number of Steps')
print(p)
```

As we can see in the plot, the time structure of the activity is similar. However, it
appears the subject does (quite reasonably) get moving a little later, and generally
takes fewer steps, on weekends.
